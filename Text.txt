Hello world my name is Devansh and T am the best at making Projects
To hate is an easy lazy thing but to love takes strength everyone has but not all are willing to practice
Love is not about property, diamonds, and gifts. It is about sharing your very self with the world around you
Let the love you give come back and find a place in you
Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it
